Platform Assessment Scores (Sorted by Priority):

Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery (BCDR)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Priority Level: 1
Personas: Operator, Manager 
Score: 0 / 20   Grade: F
══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Recommendations:

- If a critical outage occurred today, would you know the exact steps to recover? If not, define and document a disaster recovery plan immediately. Include step-by-step recovery workflows and clearly assign team responsibilities.
- Implement frequent and automated backups for persistent storage and databases. Schedule routine restore tests to verify backup reliability. Untested backups are as bad as having no backups at all.
- Establish failover procedures that go beyond documentation. Actively test them in controlled conditions to confirm they work under stress and across different failure scenarios.
- Identify key dependencies and failure points in your disaster recovery plan. Map out inter-service relationships and evaluate how failures propagate. Unresolved gaps in recovery planning can turn a minor incident into an extended outage.

--------------------------------------------------

Container Images / Management
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Priority Level: 1
Personas: Operator, Manager 
Score: 4 / 16   Grade: F
══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Recommendations:

- Establish clear container security and governance policies immediately. Without standardized controls, security risks will increase as workloads scale.
- Move away from using public registries for production workloads. Publicly sourced images may introduce vulnerabilities if they are outdated, unverified, or compromised.
- Enforce strict role-based access control (RBAC) on container registries. Restrict who can publish and promote images to prevent unauthorized modifications and potential security threats.
- Implement a process for verifying and validating container images before deployment. Ensure that only approved, security-compliant images are used in production to reduce exposure to container-based attacks.

--------------------------------------------------

Implementation and Support Services
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Priority Level: 1
Personas: Operator 
Score: 0 / 5   Grade: F
══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Recommendations:

- Provide targeted Kubernetes training programs to build internal expertise and reduce reliance on trial-and-error troubleshooting.
- Develop a structured incident response and troubleshooting process. Ensure teams know how to diagnose issues, escalate effectively, and document resolutions to improve reliability over time.

--------------------------------------------------

Backup / Restore
══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Priority Level: 1
Personas: Operator
