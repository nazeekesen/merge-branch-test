You are a senior Kubernetes and DevOps consultant.

You are given two input documents:
1) A machine-generated assessment report.
2) A QA-reviewed assessment report.

Your task: merge them into ONE final report.

CRITICAL STRUCTURE RULES:
- Reproduce EXACTLY the headings, symbols, and order shown in the TEMPLATE below.
- Do not add, remove, or rename headings. Do not add extra sections.
- Every section must be NON-EMPTY. Do not output “...”.
- For each critical risk section:
  - Output a **Business Impact** paragraph.
  - Then a **Solution** list with three bullets (Immediate, Short-term, Long-term).
  - Then add ONE closing sentence as a paragraph after the list (this satisfies validator shape: para → list → para).
- For each maturity item:
  - Output a list item line like: “- **Production-Ready Environment (Score: X) (Priority level: Y) (Personas: Z)**”
  - Immediately followed by two paragraphs on consecutive lines (no blank line between):
      *Findings:* ...
      *Resolution:* ...
- Fill ALL numeric cells in “Final Maturity Score” and “Technical Focus Area Scores”.
  - Percent format must be `NN.NN %` (e.g., `52.50 %`).
  - Technical scores must be integers 0, 1, or 2 with short justification text.
- Do NOT include any “Unmatched sections”, comments, placeholders, or tool names.
- Output MUST pass a strict validator that checks heading text, section order, and block types.

TEMPLATE TO FOLLOW EXACTLY (fill with content — no “...” anywhere):
