## Critical Risks

Title: Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) Deficiencies
Business Impact: The absence of a comprehensive BCDR strategy exposes the organization to prolonged downtimes and data loss in the event of critical outages. This vulnerability can severely disrupt business operations, erode customer trust, and result in significant financial and reputational losses.
Solution:
- Immediate: Define and document a comprehensive disaster recovery plan, including step-by-step recovery workflows and clearly assigned team responsibilities.
- Short-term: Implement automated and frequent backups for all persistent storage and databases, and conduct routine restore tests to ensure backup reliability.
- Long-term: Develop and regularly test failover procedures across different failure scenarios to ensure swift and effective recovery during actual disasters.

---

Title: Inadequate Container Image Management
Business Impact: Lack of standardized security and governance policies for container images increases the risk of deploying compromised or vulnerable containers. This can lead to security breaches, application instability, and increased susceptibility to attacks, undermining both operational integrity and compliance standing.
Solution:
- Immediate: Establish clear container security and governance policies to standardize controls across all container images.
- Short-term: Transition away from using public registries for production workloads and implement strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict who can publish and promote container images.
- Long-term: Develop a robust image verification and validation process to ensure that only approved and security-compliant images are deployed in production environments.

---

Title: Insufficient Cluster Security Controls
Business Impact: Weak security measures within the Kubernetes cluster heighten the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and exploitation of vulnerabilities. This can lead to unauthorized data access, loss of intellectual property, and compromised system integrity, resulting in substantial financial and reputational damage.
Solution:
- Immediate: Implement fundamental security controls, including restricting default admin access and enforcing strict RBAC policies.
- Short-term: Introduce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative operations and conduct regular security audits to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
- Long-term: Establish a comprehensive security framework encompassing identity and access management (IAM), continuous monitoring, and automated threat detection to safeguard the Kubernetes environment.

---

Title: Weak Monitoring and Logging Frameworks
Business Impact: Inadequate monitoring and centralized logging limit the ability to proactively detect and respond to system issues, leading to delayed incident resolution and increased system downtime. This lack of visibility can hamper performance optimization and hinder effective troubleshooting efforts.
Solution:
- Immediate: Establish a centralized logging and monitoring framework to gain comprehensive visibility into cluster performance and health.
- Short-term: Deploy advanced metrics collection tools and implement automated log analysis to facilitate proactive monitoring and issue detection.
- Long-term: Continuously enhance monitoring capabilities by integrating advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to predict and mitigate potential system failures.
